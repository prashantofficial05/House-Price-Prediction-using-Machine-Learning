### House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

**Introduction:**

  This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features of properties using historical 
  housing data. Using regression models, we analyze the impact of each feature on the final sale price, 
  which helps in identifying key factors influencing property prices across different locations.

  **Goal:**
  
   To build a robust regression model that accurately predicts house prices, enabling real estate 
   stakeholders to make data-driven pricing and investment decisions.

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:** Focus on property characteristics that influence house prices, such as area, quality 
         of materials, and location.
   - **Data Collection:**The dataset contains various property features like 1stFlrSF, GrLivArea, 
         OverallQual, and YearBuilt along with SalePrice as the target variable.
   - **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering on 
       relevant variables like LotFrontage, GarageArea, and TotalBsmtSF.
   - **Model Training:** Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and 
       evaluate their performance.
   - **Feature Importance:** Identify the most significant features affecting house prices and visualize 
       their impact.
     
**Skills:**
   - Python for data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
   - Regression modeling techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² for model performance comparison
   - Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret feature importance.
     
**Metrics:**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual prices.
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the average squared differences between predicted and 
       actual prices.
   - R² Score: Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
   
**Summary:**

  This project delivers a predictive model for house prices based on historical data, providing insights 
  into significant property features that drive market value. This can help real estate agents, buyers, and 
  sellers understand key pricing factors in different housing markets.

**Next Steps:**
   - Enhance prediction accuracy by using advanced techniques such as stacking multiple models.
   - Integrate external datasets like local economic indicators or market trends to improve predictions.
   - Build an interactive dashboard to visualize house price predictions and feature impacts for different 
     areas and property types.
